# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage provides study guidelines for a bootcamp student who wants to brush up on materials covered during Prework. The build of the webpage helped me practice new coding processes and strategies as I read about them, and it now functions as a resource to help me review what I've learned!
